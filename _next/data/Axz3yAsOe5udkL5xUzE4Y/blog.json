How to become rich like your peers?</h4>\n<p><em>Buying stocks? or even Crypto?</em></p>\n<p><em>Start a business?</em></p>\n<p>Well, yeah maybe. I said maybe because even if you followed their paths, it does not mean you will get what they got as well.</p>\n<p>Then, what’s the point of this post? Imma leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>WAIT! I promised you that I will tell you the sure way to become wealthy (<em>not rich</em>).</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, good? Let’s start.</p>\n<h3>1. Check your Financial Health</h3>\n<p>If you want to grow your money faster, you’ll need to know your current financial health.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have an income? (<em>You need to have an income to grow money, or else what to grow?</em>)</li>\n<li>Do you have any debts? (<em>Preferably don’t have any debts, but we don’t know everyone’s situation right?</em>)</li>\n<li>Is it higher than your income? (<em>Well, if it’s higher, then it means you cannot pay your own debt.</em>)</li>\n<li>Do you save every month? (<em>It’s okay if it’s not that much, 10$ is better than none</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are a few questions you need to ask yourself and answer honestly. Do all the calculations, even if it’s scary.</p>\n<p>If you pass all the questions, congrats!</p>\n<p><strong>At least, you can take care of your own ass.</strong></p>\n<h3>2. Track and allocate.</h3>\n<p>Second of all, do you track your expenses? Well if you don’t, I suggest you do so.</p>\n<p>By tracking your expenses, you will know how much you spent each month on average.</p>\n<blockquote>But, I’m forgetful, how can I track every single expense.</blockquote>\n<p>Well, maybe you can go the second route. Allocate your monthly budgeting.</p>\n<p>There are two routes to choose from:</p>\n<ul><li>Lazy way:</li></ul>\n<p>If you hate doing tedious things like spreadsheets and you have two debit cards, you can allocate a monthly allowance on one card, and use the other one for savings.</p>\n<p>It’s easier this way, and it allows you to spend whatever you want as long as you still got the money on the card. Keep in mind to never transfer more money from the savings card.</p>\n<ul><li>Nice way:</li></ul>\n<p>If you are a spreadsheet guru, then I highly recommend you to use spreadsheets on creating monthly budgeting.

But it is what it is.</p>\n<p>So I thought of fixing this habit.</p>\n<p>I like to watch YouTube videos.</p>\n<blockquote>When I eat, I watch YouTube.<br>When I’m bored, I watch YouTube.<br>When I’m learning, I watch YouTube.</blockquote>\n<p>See, that is where I spent my 6–7 hours on.</p>\n<p>So yeah, I saw a video that talks about <strong>Digital Minimalism</strong>.</p>\n<p>A few minutes into the video, I think this is interesting. <br>And I said to myself, “Well, It doesn’t hurt to try it anyway”.</p>\n<p>So I did it.</p>\n<p>So this is what I’ve learned <br>Here it is:</p>\n<h4>First step.<br>Delete Your Social Media.</h4>\n<p>You’re crazy. You must be calling me that now.<br>Chill, chill.</p>\n<p>What I meant by that is you delete your social media apps that you think takes too much of your time but don’t give much value to you.</p>\n<p>But if you get values on those social media apps, then go ahead and use them. <em>(Like if you make money from there).</em></p>\n<p><strong>BUT</strong> If you use those apps and you only waste your time there, then delete it. Delete your Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and even YouTube.<br><em>(You only can disable your YouTube app though, well it does the same thing so yeah).</em></p>\n<p>The hardest app for me to delete is YouTube. It takes me a lot of will to delete it. <em>(You saw how often I used YouTube earlier, so you can understand right? or maybe not.)</em></p>\n<p>You deleted all those apps. Then what?</p>\n<h4>Second Step.<br>Put your essential apps on your home screen. So you can use them more easily.</h4>\n<p><em>(Reduce the friction, you know)</em></p>\n<p>If you are a writer, maybe keep your note-taking app in the front.<br>If you like to travel around, maybe you need your maps app.</p>\n<p>You can decide that for yourself. ;)</p>\n<h4>Third Step<br>If you can’t control your playing time when playing games. Delete them.</h4>\n<p>You’re crazy.</p>\n<p>Did you call me crazy twice already?</p>\n<p>Man, if you like to play games but you can’t control your playtime. Then your phone usage time will stay the same.</p>\n<p>But, but, if you are confident that you can control yourself then it’s up to you to delete it or not.</p>\n<h4>Last Step<br>Last but not least, Turn Off Your Phone Notification<br>If it’s not relevant to you to be reached quickly, then turn it off.</h4>\n<p>Notification can be so distracting at times.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<p>So yeah, that’s it. Steps to becoming more productive!<br><em>(Well, if you reduce your phone usage time and then you just stare into the blank space, I don’t think you can call that productive though..)</em></p>\n<p>I applied these steps on my phone. And you know what, I reduced my phone usage time from 6 hours daily to only 2 hours daily.</p>\n<p>I’m still trying to not on my phone so much though. But I think It’s good enough already.</p>\n<blockquote>Keep your phone down when you are socializing.</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e312b154baf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0koyzPSwv1ovillBsshQow.jpeg\"></figure><blockquote>Duh, I don’t have enough time.

But it is what it is.</p>\n<p>So I thought of fixing this habit.</p>\n<p>I like to watch YouTube videos.</p>\n<blockquote>When I eat, I watch YouTube.<br>When I’m bored, I watch YouTube.<br>When I’m learning, I watch YouTube.</blockquote>\n<p>See, that is where I spent my 6–7 hours on.</p>\n<p>So yeah, I saw a video that talks about <strong>Digital Minimalism</strong>.</p>\n<p>A few minutes into the video, I think this is interesting. <br>And I said to myself, “Well, It doesn’t hurt to try it anyway”.</p>\n<p>So I did it.</p>\n<p>So this is what I’ve learned <br>Here it is:</p>\n<h4>First step.<br>Delete Your Social Media.</h4>\n<p>You’re crazy. You must be calling me that now.<br>Chill, chill.</p>\n<p>What I meant by that is you delete your social media apps that you think takes too much of your time but don’t give much value to you.</p>\n<p>But if you get values on those social media apps, then go ahead and use them. <em>(Like if you make money from there).</em></p>\n<p><strong>BUT</strong> If you use those apps and you only waste your time there, then delete it. Delete your Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and even YouTube.<br><em>(You only can disable your YouTube app though, well it does the same thing so yeah).</em></p>\n<p>The hardest app for me to delete is YouTube. It takes me a lot of will to delete it. <em>(You saw how often I used YouTube earlier, so you can understand right? or maybe not.)</em></p>\n<p>You deleted all those apps. Then what?</p>\n<h4>Second Step.<br>Put your essential apps on your home screen. So you can use them more easily.</h4>\n<p><em>(Reduce the friction, you know)</em></p>\n<p>If you are a writer, maybe keep your note-taking app in the front.<br>If you like to travel around, maybe you need your maps app.</p>\n<p>You can decide that for yourself. ;)</p>\n<h4>Third Step<br>If you can’t control your playing time when playing games. Delete them.</h4>\n<p>You’re crazy.</p>\n<p>Did you call me crazy twice already?</p>\n<p>Man, if you like to play games but you can’t control your playtime. Then your phone usage time will stay the same.</p>\n<p>But, but, if you are confident that you can control yourself then it’s up to you to delete it or not.</p>\n<h4>Last Step<br>Last but not least, Turn Off Your Phone Notification<br>If it’s not relevant to you to be reached quickly, then turn it off.</h4>\n<p>Notification can be so distracting at times.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<p>So yeah, that’s it. Steps to becoming more productive!<br><em>(Well, if you reduce your phone usage time and then you just stare into the blank space, I don’t think you can call that productive though..)</em></p>\n<p>I applied these steps on my phone. And you know what, I reduced my phone usage time from 6 hours daily to only 2 hours daily.</p>\n<p>I’m still trying to not on my phone so much though. But I think It’s good enough already.</p>\n<blockquote>Keep your phone down when you are socializing.</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e312b154baf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["digital-minimalism","social-media","digital","wellbeing","screentime"]},{"title":"How Minimalism can help you live a Better Life","pubDate":"2020-01-23 05:56:13","link":"https://wisuja.medium.com/how-minimalism-can-help-you-live-a-better-life-d89c3ccd9d2b?source=rss-3e448fdc1a01------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/d89c3ccd9d2b","author":"William Surya Jaya","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3eT75OZoKX8CUZWiSC7kUg.jpeg","description":"\n<h3>How Minimalism Can Save Your Time</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3eT75OZoKX8CUZWiSC7kUg.jpeg\"></figure><blockquote>Minimalism is kinda trendy nowadays.
