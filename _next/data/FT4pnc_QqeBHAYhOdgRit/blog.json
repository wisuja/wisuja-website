I promised you that I will tell you the sure way to become wealthy (<em>not rich</em>).</strong></p>\n<p>Okay, good? Let’s start.</p>\n<h3>1. Check your Financial Health</h3>\n<p>If you want to grow your money faster, you’ll need to know your current financial health.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have an income? (<em>You need to have an income to grow money, or else what to grow?</em>)</li>\n<li>Do you have any debts? (<em>Preferably don’t have any debts, but we don’t know everyone’s situation right?</em>)</li>\n<li>Is it higher than your income? (<em>Well, if it’s higher, then it means you cannot pay your own debt.</em>)</li>\n<li>Do you save every month? (<em>It’s okay if it’s not that much, 10$ is better than none</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are a few questions you need to ask yourself and answer honestly.

Keep in mind to never transfer more money from the savings card.</p>\n<ul><li>Nice way:</li></ul>\n<p>If you are a spreadsheet guru, then I highly recommend you to use spreadsheets on creating monthly budgeting.

Yes.<br>Bad? No.</p>\n<p>It just what it is now, people put every kind of information on the internet.</p>\n<h4><strong>Then, why we fell into “Tutorial Hell”?</strong></h4>\n<p>Because we feel overwhelmed to do something that is unknown to us.<br>By following a tutorial, we get this feeling of comfort in mind that we will accomplish something, and a tutorial is risk-free.</p>\n<p>What I meant by risk-free is you don’t have to go through stress to fix stuff.<br>It’s all there for you to follow.</p>\n<p>Also, when we finished a tutorial, we get a sense of progression. But in the end, if you only informed how to do something, but never get your hands dirty, how the hell are you gonna master a skill?</p>\n<p>When talking about “Tutorial Hell”, we can’t forget “Impostor Syndrome”, a syndrome that makes you doubt your own skills. So, people loop on tutorials until they feel “ready”.</p>\n<h4>Now, what to do then?</h4>\n<p>It may sound obvious, but you need to <strong>get off tutorials and start building your own thing</strong>.</p>\n<p>You’ll encounter all kinds of problems that didn’t occur when you’re following a tutorial. In that way, you’ll understand better about that specific topic.</p>\n<p>Don’t doubt your own skill. How are people gonna trust you even yourself doubt your own skills?</p>\n<blockquote>It’s okay to make mistakes, my friend.</blockquote>\n<p><em>P.S I’m not totally out of this “Tutorial Hell” thingy, but I’m trying to do my own stuff too.
