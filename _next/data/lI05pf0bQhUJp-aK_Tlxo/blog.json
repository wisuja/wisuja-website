It takes me a lot of will to delete it. <em>(You saw how often I used YouTube earlier, so you can understand right? or maybe not.)</em></p>\n<p>You deleted all those apps. Then what?</p>\n<h4>Second Step.<br>Put your essential apps on your home screen.

Then your phone usage time will stay the same.</p>\n<p>But, but, if you are confident that you can control yourself then it’s up to you to delete it or not.</p>\n<h4>Last Step<br>Last but not least, Turn Off Your Phone Notification<br>If it’s not relevant to you to be reached quickly, then turn it off.</h4>\n<p>Notification can be so distracting at times.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<p>So yeah, that’s it.
