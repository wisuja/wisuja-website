Delete your Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and even YouTube.<br><em>(You only can disable your YouTube app though, well it does the same thing so yeah).</em></p>\n<p>The hardest app for me to delete is YouTube. It takes me a lot of will to delete it. <em>(You saw how often I used YouTube earlier, so you can understand right? or maybe not.)</em></p>\n<p>You deleted all those apps. Then what?</p>\n<h4>Second Step.<br>Put your essential apps on your home screen. So you can use them more easily.</h4>\n<p><em>(Reduce the friction, you know)</em></p>\n<p>If you are a writer, maybe keep your note-taking app in the front.<br>If you like to travel around, maybe you need your maps app.</p>\n<p>You can decide that for yourself. ;)</p>\n<h4>Third Step<br>If you can’t control your playing time when playing games.

Then your phone usage time will stay the same.</p>\n<p>But, but, if you are confident that you can control yourself then it’s up to you to delete it or not.</p>\n<h4>Last Step<br>Last but not least, Turn Off Your Phone Notification<br>If it’s not relevant to you to be reached quickly, then turn it off.</h4>\n<p>Notification can be so distracting at times.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion:</h4>\n<p>So yeah, that’s it. Steps to becoming more productive!<br><em>(Well, if you reduce your phone usage time and then you just stare into the blank space, I don’t think you can call that productive though..)</em></p>\n<p>I applied these steps on my phone.
